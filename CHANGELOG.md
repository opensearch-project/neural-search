## [Unreleased 3.x](https://github.com/opensearch-project/neural-search/compare/main...HEAD)

### Features
- Implement analyzer based neural sparse query ([#1088](https://github.com/opensearch-project/neural-search/pull/1088) [#1279](https://github.com/opensearch-project/neural-search/pull/1279))
- [Semantic Field] Add semantic mapping transformer. ([#1276](https://github.com/opensearch-project/neural-search/pull/1276))
- [Semantic Field] Add semantic ingest processor. ([#1309](https://github.com/opensearch-project/neural-search/pull/1309))
- [Semantic Field] Implement the query logic for the semantic field. ([#1315](https://github.com/opensearch-project/neural-search/pull/1315))

### Enhancements
